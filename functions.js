//1.Given an array of strings, use a function to reverse all the elements in the string in ascending order and the specific elements in descending order







//2.Using JS functions and an array of numbers, return positive if an element within the array is positive, negative if an element is negative, else zero





//3.Given an array of objects, where each object represents an employee with an id, name, and salary property, write a function that returns a new array of employee objects sorted by their salary in ascending order.

function sortEmployeesBySalary(employees) {
    return employees.sort((a, b) => a.salary - b.salary);
    employees(23,"Oyella",20)  }


//4.Write a function that accepts an array of numbers and uses the forEach() method to console.log each number multiplied by 2.


/
//   arr.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2));
// }
// const num= 


//5.Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and consoles the first four items multiplied by 8 and the last two added by 5. Console the array with the new values

// const newArr = [...arr];
//   newArr.slice(0, 4).forEach(num => console.log(num * 8));
//   newArr.slice(-2).forEach(num => console.log(num + 5));
